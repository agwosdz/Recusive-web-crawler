Letâ€™s first of all take a look at an unlabeled piano keyboard layout, i.e. without the note names. The one shown in the first piano keyboard layout  has two octaves, a total of 24 notes.

88 key piano, there are 36 black keys and 52 white keys. 

76 key keyboards come with 31 black keys and 45 white keys, 

61 key keyboards come with 25 black keys and 36 white keys,  

49 key keyboards have 20 black keys and 29 white ones.


So, here is my simple math for WHITE KEY INDEX:
pianowidth = striplength = 122.3 cm
whitewidth = pianowidth/52 (for 88 key piano) = 2.35 cm (ish)
Find Center LED Index:
Right to Left:
Note Nuber = MIDI-BASE+1 (1 for first and 88 for last)
First Note mid LED (lowest note, highest LED index): 
offset = whitewidth/2
Calc: INDEX  ((pianowidth - offset)/pianowidth) * number of  LED) -1
example: 121.125/122.3 * 178 = 176.29 -1 = 175.29 ROUNDUP = LED Index 176
Middle C: 24th WHITE KEY (do the math)
offset = 23*whitewidth + whitewidth/2 = 55.225
INDEX: (122.3-55.225)/122.3 * numberofLED = 97.6 -1 = 96.6 ROUNDUP LED INDEX=97 is the middle of the key

For black keys, the math will get more compolicated, as we need to account for 3 cases:
Between G and H, the black key is centered between the white keys, and its simplest: offset here is 0
((pianowidth - offset - INDEX will be number white keys at preceding halftone * whitewidth)/pianowidth)  * led count, then subtract 1 and round up
For the other ones, we need to have an offset: if preceding note is C or F, it is like above, but we subtract the offset for black keys with preceding A or D, insted of subtracting the offset, we add the offset
