# Index Override Guide - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The `--index-override` feature has been enhanced to **always apply the override file** for both parsing and saving, ensuring that corrected JavaScript paths and other resources in your override file are used instead of the original online content.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Always Apply Override
- **Before**: Override only applied to root URLs (`/` or empty path)
- **After**: Override **always applies** regardless of URL path
- **Benefit**: Ensures corrected paths are used consistently

### 2. Parse Override Content
- **Before**: Override file only replaced saved content, original online content was used for parsing
- **After**: Override file content is **parsed for resource discovery**
- **Benefit**: JavaScript, CSS, and image paths from your corrected file are extracted and processed

### 3. Enhanced Resource Tracking
- **Before**: Only successful downloads were tracked in results
- **After**: All discovered resources are tracked, regardless of download success
- **Benefit**: You can verify that corrected paths are being detected

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Always use override file for parsing and saving
python web_scraper.py -u https://example.com/ --mirror --index-override corrected_index.html
```

### With JavaScript Processing
```bash
# Process JavaScript dependencies from corrected paths
python web_scraper.py -u https://example.com/ --mirror --index-override corrected_index.html --process-js
```

### Sub-page Override (Now Supported)
```bash
# Override now works for sub-pages too
python web_scraper.py -u https://example.com/dashboard --mirror --index-override corrected_dashboard.html
```

## Real-World Scenario

### Problem
Original website at `https://example.com/` has:
```html
<!-- Broken paths -->
<script src="/old/broken/app.js"></script>
<script src="/wrong/utils.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/missing/style.css">
```

### Solution
Create `corrected_index.html` with:
```html
<!-- Corrected paths -->
<script src="/js/app.js"></script>
<script src="/lib/utils.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style.css">
```

### Result
```bash
python web_scraper.py -u https://example.com/ --mirror --index-override corrected_index.html
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Scraper parses `corrected_index.html` instead of online content
2. ✅ Discovers `/js/app.js`, `/lib/utils.js`, `/assets/style.css`
3. ✅ Attempts to download corrected paths
4. ✅ Saves `corrected_index.html` content to `mirrored_site/index.html`
5. ✅ All other scraper features work normally

## Log Messages to Look For

### Success Indicators
```
INFO - Using override content for parsing: https://example.com/
INFO - Saved HTML with override: mirrored_site/index.html
```

### Resource Discovery
```
ERROR - Error downloading js https://example.com/js/corrected-app.js: 404 Client Error
```
*Note: 404 errors are expected if corrected paths don't exist on the server, but this confirms the corrected paths are being used.*

## Verification Methods

### 1. Check Discovered Resources
Run the scraper and look for your corrected paths in the error messages or results.

### 2. Use Test Script
```bash
python test_override_parsing.py
```

### 3. Use Diagnostic Tool
```bash
python diagnose_override.py
```

### 4. Run Complete Example
```bash
python example_corrected_paths.py
```

## File Structure After Scraping

```
mirrored_site/
├── index.html          # Contains your override content
├── js/                 # Downloaded JS files (if they exist)
├── css/                # Downloaded CSS files (if they exist)
├── images/             # Downloaded images (if they exist)
└── ...
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. Fix Broken CDN Links
```html
<!-- Original (broken) -->
<script src="https://old-cdn.com/library.js"></script>

<!-- Override (working) -->
<script src="https://new-cdn.com/library.js"></script>
```

### 2. Update API Endpoints
```html
<!-- Original -->
<script>
    const API_BASE = 'https://old-api.com';
</script>

<!-- Override -->
<script>
    const API_BASE = 'https://new-api.com';
</script>
```

### 3. Correct Import Paths
```html
<!-- Original -->
<script type="module">
    import { utils } from '/wrong/path/utils.js';
</script>

<!-- Override -->
<script type="module">
    import { utils } from '/correct/path/utils.js';
</script>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Override Not Applied
1. Check file path is correct (absolute or relative)
2. Verify file exists and is readable
3. Run `diagnose_override.py` for detailed analysis

### Resources Not Found
1. ✅ **Expected behavior** - corrected paths may not exist on server
2. Check that override content contains the paths you expect
3. Verify HTML syntax in override file

### JavaScript Processing Issues
1. Ensure `--process-js` flag is used
2. Check that corrected JS files are valid JavaScript
3. Review import/export syntax in corrected files

## Benefits Summary

✅ **Always applies override** - No more path-based restrictions  
✅ **Parses override content** - Resource discovery from corrected file  
✅ **Saves override content** - Final file contains your corrections  
✅ **Works with all features** - JavaScript processing, mirroring, etc.  
✅ **Maintains compatibility** - All existing functionality preserved  
✅ **Enhanced debugging** - Better resource tracking and logging  

## Migration from Previous Version

If you were using the old version:
- **No changes needed** - All existing commands work the same
- **New capability** - Override now works for all URLs, not just root
- **Better results** - Resources are discovered from your corrected file

*This implementation ensures that your corrected JavaScript paths and other resources are treated as the authoritative source for both parsing and saving operations.*
